# Android CI/CD Project
This repository was prepared for a technical challenge and demonstrates a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) pipeline for an Android project. The goal is to automate the app's build, testing, and delivery process.

## Features
This pipeline is triggered by every push to the main branch and executes the following steps:

- Security Validation: scans the project's dependencies for security vulnerabilities.

- Code Analysis: runs unit tests and performs static analysis to ensure code quality.

- Build and Artifacts: compiles the app and generates the .apk and .aab files.

- Automatic Deployment: automatically publishes the new app version to Firebase App Distribution.

### Setup
First of all, it is needed to add your google-services.json file to:
'app/google-services.json'. 
After that, configure two access keys in GitHub repository (in the Secrets section):

FIREBASE_APP_ID: Firebase app ID.

FIREBASE_TOKEN: The authentication token generated by the Firebase CLI.

### Optional local setup and test
- Make sure you have JDK 17 installed.

- Install Android SDK or Android Studio if running builds locally.

- Run the following commands locally to test the pipeline:
```
./gradlew build
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
./gradlew lintDebug
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

### Execution
Once configured, simply run the following commands:
```
# Add files
git add .

# Save changes
git commit -m "insert your commit message here"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```
After this, the pipeline is automatically triggered. It is possible to track the progress in the Actions tab of the repository.

## NOTES

- Caching: Gradle caches are used to speed up CI builds.

- Jacoco report: Coverage reports are generated as HTML file for inspection.

- APK and AAB files are uploaded as artifacts in GitHub Actions
